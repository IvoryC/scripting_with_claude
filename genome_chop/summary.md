## genome-chop.py

A Python script that takes FASTA files and produces overlapping sequence chunks in FASTQ format with Illumina-style headers. Features include sliding window mode, random sequence mode, sequence limits, directory output support, and gzip compression.

```bash
python3 genome-chop.py --help
```

```text
usage: genome-chop.py [-h] -i INPUT_FILE -c CHUNK_SIZE -s SLIDE_BP
                      [-n MAX_SEQUENCES] [-o OUTPUT] [-z] [-v]

Chop genome sequences into overlapping chunks

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i INPUT_FILE, --input-file INPUT_FILE
                        Input FASTA file path
  -c CHUNK_SIZE, --chunk-size CHUNK_SIZE
                        Size of each chunk (in bases)
  -s SLIDE_BP, --slide-bp SLIDE_BP
                        Step size between chunks (in bases). Use 0 for random
                        mode
  -n MAX_SEQUENCES, --max-sequences MAX_SEQUENCES
                        Maximum number of output sequences to produce
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Output FASTQ file or directory. If directory (ends
                        with /), uses default filename. Default:
                        input_name_chopped.fastq in input directory
  -z, --gzip            Compress output with gzip (.gz extension added
                        automatically)
  -v, --version         show program's version number and exit

Examples:
  genome-chop.py -i input.fa -c 100 -s 50                       # 100bp chunks, 50bp steps
  genome-chop.py -i input.fa -c 75 -s 25 -n 1000               # Limit to 1000 sequences
  genome-chop.py -i input.fa -c 150 -s 0 -n 500                # Random mode: 500 random 150bp chunks
  genome-chop.py -i input.fa -c 200 -s 100 -o results/         # Output to directory with default name
  genome-chop.py -i input.fa -c 100 -s 50 -z                   # Gzip compressed output
  genome-chop.py -i input.fa -c 100 -s 50 -o output/ -z        # Gzip output to directory
  genome-chop.py --input-file genome.fa --chunk-size 200 --slide-bp 100  # Long form options

Output Options:
  -o filename.fastq    : Specific output filename
  -o directory/        : Use default filename in specified directory
  -z                   : Compress output with gzip (.gz extension added automatically)

Modes:
  Sliding window mode (slide-bp > 0): Creates overlapping chunks at regular intervals
  Random mode (slide-bp = 0): Selects random start positions for chunks

The script reads FASTA format files and outputs overlapping sequence chunks
in FASTQ format with Illumina-style headers and high-quality base scores. 
Each output sequence uses standard Illumina header format for compatibility
with downstream tools like Kraken, BWA, etc.

## Conversation Summary

**Human User:** We're going to write a short script in Python. Everything we create today is going to live in a main folder. I may make reference to the main folder, but you should never assume that you know the name of the main folder. All file paths should be relative paths. Within the main folder, we will have a sub folder called script, this is where the main artifact that create is going to live. There will also be a test folder, which will contain an input folder and an output folder. We're going to make some test input, and a test script that will live in the test folder.

Create a test input file in fast, a format called "test_genome.fa", it should have a single sequence with 300 bases.

Our main script will be a python script called genome-chop.py.

The main script will take a few arguments from the command line. The first argument is the input gene on file. In the test script, we should use relative paths to call the main script and the test input file. The main script will also need to take arguments for chunk size and slide size. The script should chop out the genome sequence and produce an output file of many sequence trunks. The output file should be in fast Q format, arbitrarily use high-quality base call scores, like illumina data. The name for each output sequence should include the original input file name, just the name, and the genomic range that this sequence came from. On the plus line of the fastq output for each sequence, say "in-silico subsequence".

**Claude:** Created the project structure with three artifacts: test_genome.fa (300-base FASTA sequence), genome-chop.py (main Python script with command-line arguments for input file, chunk size, and slide size), and test_script.py (Python test runner). The main script reads FASTA files, generates overlapping chunks, and outputs FASTQ format with high-quality scores.

*Artifacts created: test_genome.fa, genome-chop.py, test_script.py*

**Human User:** Add functionality to the main script to print a help page.

**Claude:** Enhanced the main script with comprehensive help functionality including detailed description, usage examples, clear parameter explanations, and version information using argparse's RawDescriptionHelpFormatter.

*Artifact updated: genome-chop.py*

**Human User:** modify how the sequences in the output are named so that instead of producing "test_genome_25_74" it will produce "test_genome:25-74"

**Claude:** Updated the sequence naming format to use colon and dash notation (test_genome:25-74) which follows standard genomic coordinate conventions used in bioinformatics tools.

*Artifact updated: genome-chop.py*

**Human User:** In our main script, take named arguments rather than position arguments. Instead of slide_size call it slide-bp.

**Claude:** Converted all positional arguments to named arguments with short and long forms: -i/--input-file, -c/--chunk-size, -s/--slide-bp, -o/--output, -v/--version. Updated help examples to reflect the new command-line interface.

*Artifact updated: genome-chop.py*

**Human User:** add an argument -n to indicate the maximum number of output sequences to produce. Create enough sequences to cover the entire input genome, or stop with N sequences have been produced, which ever happens first.  If they slide BP value is zero use random sequence mode. In random sequence mode, select random start points in the genome to produce n sequence chunks. Give the user comment about the total basis in the output and the total bases in the input and what the average coverage is.

**Claude:** Added -n/--max-sequences argument, implemented random sequence mode (when slide-bp=0), and added coverage statistics reporting. The script now supports both sliding window and random sampling modes with detailed output about input/output bases and coverage.

*Artifact updated: genome-chop.py*

**Human User:** Create a new test script. This will be a bash script that calls the program several times with simple one line calls and verify that the output meet expectations. The test script should test the features we have discussed.

**Claude:** Created a comprehensive bash test script with 10 tests covering all features: basic sliding window, sequence limits, random mode, large chunks, sequence naming, FASTQ format, help functionality, default filenames, edge cases, and coverage statistics. Includes color-coded output, detailed verification, and summary with pass/fail counts.

*Artifact created: test_features.sh*

**Human User:** I tried to run the output through kraken. It complained that there was no direction indicator.  I think we need to make the sequence headers look more like illumina sequence headers.

**Claude:** Updated the script to generate proper Illumina-style FASTQ headers with direction indicators for Kraken compatibility. Headers now follow format: @SIM:001:INSILICO:1:0001:00025:00074 1:N:0:ATCG with genomic coordinates preserved in the comment line.

*Artifact updated: genome-chop.py*

**Human User:** great. Make the appropriat updates to the bash test script

**Claude:** Updated the bash test script to properly test Illumina-style headers and added a new test specifically for Kraken compatibility that verifies direction indicators are present in all sequences.

*Artifact updated: test_features.sh*

**Human User:** If the output specified by the user is a directory rather than a file, then use the default name and convention as the base name and use the specified output directory. If a final path ends with a/

**Claude:** Added intelligent directory output handling. When output ends with '/' or is an existing directory, the script uses the default filename convention (input_name_chopped.fastq) in the specified directory. Updated help documentation with examples.

*Artifact updated: genome-chop.py*

**Human User:** Add another argument that allows the user to specify the output should be gzip. If this is specified, gzip the output. Update the help file accordingly. Also update the help file for the last change we made. And update the test file appropriately for both changes.

**Claude:** Added -z/--gzip argument for compression support, automatically adds .gz extension, works with both file and directory outputs. Updated help documentation and added 4 new tests (12-15) to verify directory output, gzip compression, combined directory+gzip, and random mode with gzip.

*Artifacts updated: genome-chop.py, test_features.sh*

**Human User:** I just ran the tests. They all passed except for the last three. 13 14 and 15 failed. I'm pasting the output.

[Error output showing zcat issues with .gz files]

**Claude:** Fixed the test script by replacing `zcat` with `gunzip -c` in the count_sequences function. The issue was that `zcat` on macOS expects .Z files (Unix compress) rather than .gz files (gzip format).

*Artifact updated: test_features.sh*

**Human User:** No need to reply to this comment. That looks good all the tests passed now.

**Human User:** I like the style that was used for the test script. How can I describe this very succinctly so that you can use the same style again in the future? I like the color coating in the output. I like that each test is clearly defined and the past fail is clearly defined. I like that at the end it tells me how many past or failed. I like the little emoji at the end. This is all very nice.

I do have one critique though. I would like it if the screen output for each test would also show me the exact command that was run. I'd like it to be something that I could copy and paste so that I could rerun an individual test manually very easily. Please update the test script. Then write a short text file that I could save and upload in the future to tell you how to make future test scripts.

**Claude:** Added run_command() function that displays each command in yellow before execution, making it easy to copy-paste for manual testing. Updated all tests to use this pattern. Created a comprehensive style guide document capturing the preferred testing style with color-coded output, clear structure, command visibility, and visual feedback.

*Artifacts updated: test_features.sh; created: test_script_style_guide.txt*

**Human User:** That's very nice thank you.

**Human User:** Very briefly describe the file structure we used so that I can copy and paste the description in future chats.

**Claude:** Provided a brief ASCII tree structure description showing the main_folder with script/ and test/ subdirectories, noting that all paths are relative within the project structure.

**Human User:** What is the term for the style that you just used to display the file structure?

**Claude:** Explained that it's called "ASCII tree structure" or "directory tree notation" using characters like ├──, └──, and │.

**Human User:** How can I do that from the command line? My computer is a Mac.

**Claude:** Provided instructions for installing and using the `tree` command via Homebrew, along with common usage examples and alternative methods using built-in commands.

**Human User:** write a summary of this conversation called summary.md.
At the top, show the file structure.  you can ommit the python text script, we ended up using the bash script instead.
After the file structure, have a section about genome-shop.py, briefly describe what it does and then show a code block where you call the script to display the help file.
Then have a section for our chat.  Include my comments exactly as they are, and provide brief summaries of what you said and did. Note each time that an artifact is produced or updated.

**Claude:** Created this summary document with the requested structure: file tree, genome-chop.py description with help command example, and detailed conversation summary with exact Human User comments and brief Claude summaries noting all artifact creation and updates.
