## q2-genome-chop Plugin

A QIIME 2 plugin that converts the standalone genome-chop.py script into a fully integrated QIIME 2 workflow tool. The plugin maintains all original functionality (sliding window mode, random sequence mode, sequence limits, gzip compression) while adding QIIME 2 benefits like provenance tracking, artifact management, and workflow integration. The plugin generates Illumina-style FASTQ outputs compatible with downstream tools like Kraken.

For complete installation and usage instructions, see [QIIME2_INSTALLATION.md](QIIME2_INSTALLATION.md).

## Conversation Summary

**Human User:** Can make the genome-chop.py script into a qiime2 pluggin?

**Claude:** Explained that yes, genome-chop.py can be converted to a QIIME 2 plugin using QIIME 2's plugin framework. Outlined the requirements including Python package structure, plugin registration, type definitions, and method definitions. Noted key changes needed for QIIME 2 integration.

**Human User:** yes, I would like you to do those things.

**Claude:** Created a complete QIIME 2 plugin structure with seven artifacts: setup.py (package configuration), plugin_setup.py (QIIME 2 registration), _types.py (semantic types), _methods.py (core logic adapted for QIIME 2), __init__.py (package initialization), citations.bib (academic citations), and QIIME2_INSTALLATION.md (comprehensive installation guide). The plugin uses proper QIIME 2 input/output types and maintains all original functionality.

*Artifacts created: setup.py, plugin_setup.py, _types.py, _methods.py, __init__.py, citations.bib, QIIME2_INSTALLATION.md*

**Human User:** I went to this page: https://docs.qiime2.org/2024.10/install/native/#install-qiime-2-within-a-conda-environment

and I ran this command:

```
CONDA_SUBDIR=osx-64 conda env create -n qiime2-metagenome-2024.10 --file https://data.qiime2.org/distro/metagenome/qiime2-metagenome-2024.10-py310-osx-conda.yml
conda activate qiime2-metagenome-2024.10
conda config --env --set subdir osx-64
```

That seems to be working, but it is taking some time to download and extract many packages.
hang tight.

**Claude:** Confirmed this was the correct and up-to-date installation method. Explained that the QIIME 2 metagenome distribution is comprehensive, the CONDA_SUBDIR=osx-64 approach uses Intel packages through Rosetta for better stability, and that long installation times are normal due to 200+ scientific packages.

**Human User:** great! I activated the conda environment, and the "qiime --help" worked. I'm in the q2-genome-chop directory.

**Claude:** Provided step-by-step installation instructions for the plugin: pip install -e . (for development mode), qiime dev refresh-cache, and test commands. Explained what pip install -e . does (editable installation that links to current directory for development).

**Human User:** what does this do? "pip install -e ."

**Claude:** Explained that pip install -e . installs the package in "editable" or "development" mode, creating a link to the current directory rather than copying files. This allows immediate testing of code changes without reinstalling, registers entry points for QIIME 2 plugin discovery, and is perfect for development workflows.

**Human User:** explain this part of _types.py

```
# Register semantic types
plugin.register_semantic_types(ChoppedSequences)

# Register directory formats
plugin.register_formats(SingleLanePerSampleSingleEndFastqDirFmt)

```

**Claude:** Clarified that this code is actually in plugin_setup.py, not _types.py. Explained semantic types as QIIME 2's way of describing "what kind of data this is" (ChoppedSequences = genome chunks), and directory formats as describing "how the data is stored" (FASTQ folder structure). Explained the relationship between semantic types (WHAT) and directory formats (HOW).

**Human User:** [Error message about cannot import name 'ChoppedSequences' from partially initialized module]

**Claude:** Identified a circular import error and fixed it by updating the plugin setup to remove problematic imports. Provided reinstallation steps and troubleshooting guidance.

*Artifact updated: plugin_setup.py*

**Human User:** [Error about DNASequencesDirectoryFormat not being a QIIME 2 type]

**Claude:** Fixed the type error by changing from DNASequencesDirectoryFormat (directory format) to FeatureData[Sequence] (semantic type) in the plugin registration. Updated the methods to work with DNAFASTAFormat and simplified the processing logic for single FASTA input.

*Artifacts updated: plugin_setup.py, _methods.py*

**Human User:** [Installation completed successfully and plugin help pages working]

**Claude:** Celebrated the successful installation and confirmed that both the main plugin help and the chop-sequences method help were displaying correctly with all expected parameters and options.

**Human User:** Now lets write a test script! I think we can use the examples usages you included in the QIIME2_INSTALLATION.md document earlier.   
Here is my current file structure:

[file tree]

I want the bash script for testing the q2 plugin to go in the q2-test folder.  Use all the test style that you I like!

**Claude:** Created a comprehensive test script for the QIIME 2 plugin following the preferred testing style with color-coded output, copy-pasteable commands, and detailed verification. The script includes 10 tests covering QIIME 2 artifact import/export, basic sliding window mode, sequence limits, random mode with seed, compression, reproducibility, edge cases, FASTQ format verification, and plugin citations.

*Artifact created: test_qiime2_plugin.sh*

**Human User:** tests 2 thru 9 failed. Lets start by looking at test 2.

[Error about missing files for SingleLanePerSampleSingleEndFastqDirFmt pattern]

**Claude:** Identified that the FASTQ filename format was incorrect. QIIME 2's SingleLanePerSampleSingleEndFastqDirFmt expects files matching a specific pattern with lane information. Fixed the filename format from "chopped_sequences_R1_001.fastq" to "sampleid_sequences_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz" and made gzip compression mandatory for QIIME 2 compatibility.

*Artifact updated: _methods.py*

**Human User:** ok, but now we have a different error:

```
Plugin error from genome-chop:

  Missing one or more files for SingleLanePerSampleSingleEndFastqDirFmt: 'MANIFEST'

```

**Claude:** Fixed the missing MANIFEST file issue by adding a function to create the required MANIFEST file that describes sample mapping. The MANIFEST file contains headers (sample-id, filename, direction) and data rows mapping samples to their FASTQ files.

*Artifact updated: _methods.py*

**Human User:** qiime2 is still complaining about the manifest file. It says:
**Found header on line 1 with the following labels: ['sample-id\tfilename\tdirection'], expected: ['sample-id', 'filename', 'direction']**

I don't understand. I thought it expected a tab-delim file.... is this just not the right way to write the string for the line?

**Claude:** Initially tried to fix the tab character issue, then referenced the QIIME 2 forum discussion provided by Human User and switched to CSV format (comma-separated) instead of TSV format based on community guidance about MANIFEST file format expectations.

*Artifact updated: _methods.py*

**Human User:** I think that worked.  Great news--we get a different error now! that probably means the solution we used for the last issue is working fine, and we're moving along. 

Now qiime2 is complaining about this:
**Missing one or more files for SingleLanePerSampleSingleEndFastqDirFmt: 'metadata.yml'**

**Claude:** Added the required metadata.yml file containing Phred quality score offset information (phred-offset: 33) needed by QIIME 2 to interpret Illumina-style quality scores in the FASTQ files.

*Artifact updated: _methods.py*

**Human User:** I have to bounce between two directories.... run these commands 

```
pip uninstall q2-genome-chop
pip install -e .
qiime dev refresh-cache
```

from the plugin directory so first I run: cd ../q2-genome-chop**/**

And then I run my tests from q2-test, so I run 
cd ../q2-test
qiime genome-chop chop-sequences --i-sequences "output/input_sequences.qza" --p-chunk-size 100 --p-slide-bp 50 --o-chopped-sequences "output/basic_sliding.qza"

As we continue these iterations, could you include the cd commands?

**Claude:** Acknowledged the directory navigation need and provided complete command sequences including cd commands for easier copy-pasting during the iterative development process.

**Human User:** Hey hey! that seems to have worked:

Saved SampleData[SequencesWithQuality] to: output/basic_sliding.qza

hang tight while I run the full test set again.  Do we need to make any changes to test_qiime2_plugin.sh since we've made changes to the main scripts?

**Claude:** Confirmed that no changes were needed to the test script since it calls the plugin through the command-line interface as a "black box" tester, so all underlying bug fixes would automatically be utilized by the tests.

**Human User:** horray! All tests passed! ðŸŽ‰

**Claude:** Celebrated the successful completion with enthusiastic congratulations, summarizing the final achievement: a fully functional QIIME 2 plugin with complete integration, all original features, proper QIIME 2 formats, comprehensive testing, and excellent user experience. Noted that the plugin can now work seamlessly with other QIIME 2 tools and follow all platform best practices.

**Human User:** Write a summary for me just like the last summary. This will also be marked down format. For the file structure at the top treat the Q2 â€“ genome â€“ chop folder as the root of the tree. Briefly describe the plugin and link to the QIIME2_INSTALLATION.md file. Then summarize our chat, just like before.  Pick up from the first comment where I mentioned qiime2. The artifact should be something I can download as summary-q2.md

**Claude:** Created this comprehensive summary document covering the QIIME 2 plugin development process, including the file structure, plugin description with installation guide reference, and detailed conversation summary starting from the initial QIIME 2 question through successful completion of all tests.
